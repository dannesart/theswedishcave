            <p>
              One day, Gus, the caveman with a passion for bad branding, woke up
              to an unusual sight—a shiny spaceship parked right outside his
              cave.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ugghhh... what's this?" Gus mumbled, scratching his messy hair.
              He had never seen anything so sleek, so modern.
            </p>
            <p>
              A voice boomed from the spaceship's speakers: "Hello, Gus! We've
              come to take you to space!"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Space?" Gus grunted. "I thought you said 'face.' Are we branding
              faces?"
            </p>
            <p>
              "No, Gus! We’re going to space. To explore new worlds and bring
              stellar branding to the galaxy!"
            </p>
            <p>
              Gus thought for a moment. "Hmm... Could be fun, as long as I don’t
              have to redesign anything."
            </p>
            <p>
              Before Gus could protest, the spaceship's door opened with a loud
              whoosh, and he was swept inside. The interior was filled with
              buttons, lights, and shiny surfaces that looked too new to
              understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the spaceship zoomed off, Gus was strapped into his seat,
              looking out the window at the stars. “Stars,” he muttered, "always
              wanted to make one for my cave logo."
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey was long, but Gus kept busy imagining branding for
              space aliens. "Maybe I could help these guys! They could use a
              logo... a sleek one, with an alien head and something
              futuristic... with a good tagline."
            </p>
            <p>
              The spaceship arrived at a distant planet. Gus stepped out, his
              boots crunching on the strange, purple ground. The locals—little
              green creatures with antennae—greeted him with confused
              expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ugghh, you guys look like you need some branding," Gus said,
              nodding thoughtfully. "Let me just fix that. We’ll call it...
              ‘Galaxy Goo’!"
            </p>
            <p>
              A few hours later, Gus had transformed the alien planet's entire
              look. The green creatures were overjoyed, holding up their new
              logo: a glowing slime bucket with a sleek font. "We love it! It's
              futuristic, it's fresh!" they cheered.
            </p>
            <p>Gus grinned. "I told ya. Branding is universal!"</p>
            <p>
              As he boarded the spaceship to head back to Earth, Gus looked out
              the window one last time. He smiled, knowing that no matter how
              far you go—whether to outer space or back to the Stone Age—good
              branding always shines through.
